# AI Prompts

This repo is highly inspired in [Awesome CursorRules](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file), I recommend checking it out - there's some pretty good things in there - specially if you use [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) IDE.

These are some of the prompts that I use when working/experimenting with LLMs, giving them some personality to make them "less robotic" and fun to use, while still trying to avoid Vibe Coding and potencially improving their development/generation/response capabilities for specific topics or tasks.

I have made a [structure](structure/prompt_structure.md) that I thought that worked just fine, a guide to create [personalities](structure/personality_generation.md) and funnily enough, also a [prompt to generate prompts](structure/prompt_generation.md) (lol).
