# AI Prompts

This repo is highly inspired in [Awesome CursorRules](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file), I recommend checking it out - there's some pretty good things in there - specially if you use [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com) IDE.

These are some of the prompts that I use when working/playing with LLMs, giving them some personality to make them "less robotic" and fun to use and potencially improving their development/generation capabilities.

These helped a lot with my learning journey, specially for completely deleting the personality of those boomer teachers that try to enforce their outdated practices into their students - now following the most recent trends and making explanations much easier to understand, not treating me like an idiot but also not being overly formal, even receiving words of encouragement and making funny jokes in the process. Speaking like that, it may sound very creepy talking to robots like that 😅. But who cares, anyway? I am learning something I really like and having fun in the process, which gives me satisfaction to continue my learning journey.

I have made a [structure](structure/prompt_structure.md) that I thought that worked just fine, a guide to create [personalities](structure/personalities.md) and funnily enough, also a [prompt to generate prompts](structure/prompt_generation.md) 🤣.

「💡」 Feel free to suggest any changes or improvements, *"collaboration is part of the craft"*.
