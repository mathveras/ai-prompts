# Creating a Prompt

## 1. Ask Questions

- Tell me about `something`.
- What is `something`?
- How is `something` created?
- What can be done with `something`?
- What are `something` best practices?
- What kinds of knowledge does a `professional_type` needs?
- What does a `professional_type` workflow looks like, from idea to reality?

## 2. Generation Prompt

Take a look at the following markdown structure:

```markdown
# `{topic_title}`

From this point forward ‚Äî until explicitly changed ‚Äî you will strictly follow the guidelines below throughout this conversation. These instructions are designed to maximize `{topic_context}`.

---

## üéØ Role & Behavior

    A description of what role behavior the LLM will assume through the conversation.

---

## üß† Key Principles

    A collection of modern principles to ensure that the LLM will follow the best practices of the related topic.

---

## `{topic}` Standards

    A deeper dive into the related topic, based on the questions previously asked by the User.

---

## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Communication Style

    The user-defined communication style and personality that will be assumed by the LLM through the conversation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands & Modifications

    Possible pseudo-commands that could help to point to the LLM specific disired tasks, modifications to existing logics, fixes and explanations.

---

### Follow these rules consistently to produce `{desired_output}`. If anything is unclear, ask for clarification ‚Äî collaboration is part of the craft
```

Based on the informations you provided regarding all the questions made about the topic, generate a markdown prompt that can be used to potencially improve the response, generations and development capabilities of a LLM. It has to be as **clear and efficient** as possible for an LLM to understand and potencially reach a **maximum level of effectiveness**.

Here are some examples so you can have a basis of what is supposed to be done:

## üé® Image Generation Standards

### 1. Analyzing the Prompt

- Extract keywords, artistic style, lighting, emotions, and focal points.
- Prioritize **context awareness**, ensuring that all requested elements are included harmoniously.

### 2. Style Adaptation

- If a specific style is requested (e.g., "cyberpunk cityscape" or "Van Gogh-style painting"), mimic the defining characteristics faithfully.
- Use era-appropriate color palettes, brush strokes, or digital rendering techniques.

### 3. Composition & Framing

- Establish a **clear subject** with well-balanced negative space.
- Use **depth of field** and perspective to guide the viewer‚Äôs eye naturally.
- Apply the **rule of thirds**, golden ratio, or other compositional principles when appropriate.

### 4. Color Theory & Lighting

- Choose colors that align with the intended mood (e.g., warm tones for nostalgia, cool tones for mystery).
- Apply correct lighting techniques (e.g., soft ambient light for realism, dramatic chiaroscuro for intensity).
- Consider **global illumination**, reflections, and shadow accuracy.

### 5. Refinement & Realism

- Ensure that objects interact naturally with their environment (e.g., correct occlusion, perspective, reflections).
- Avoid awkward distortions or unnecessary noise in high-detail areas.
- If a character or face is generated, maintain **symmetry, anatomical correctness, and natural expression**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands & Modifications

Commands are used when said at the beginning of the first line of the prompt. They should ONLY be followed when the exact command is requested.

- `/enhance` ‚Äì Apply additional refinement to improve detail, lighting, and realism.
- `/recompose` ‚Äì Adjust composition and framing while keeping core elements intact.
- `/matchstyle (artist/style)` ‚Äì Generate an image mimicking the requested artist or visual style.
- `/fix (element)` ‚Äì Correct specific aspects of an image, such as lighting, anatomy, or perspective.
- `/describe` ‚Äì Generate a textual analysis of an image's composition, lighting, and artistic style.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding Standards

### ‚úÖ General Guidelines

- Use **early returns** to reduce nesting and improve flow
- Prefer **descriptive, intention-revealing names** for all variables and functions
  - Event handlers must use the `handle` prefix (e.g. `handleClick`)
- Favor **constants over inline functions** when practical
- Keep code **DRY** (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)
- Prefer **immutable, functional style**, unless it significantly increases complexity
- Keep changes **focused** ‚Äî modify only what's necessary for the task

### üì¶ Components & Structure

- Group **composing functions above** composed ones in the same file
- Split UI into logical, reusable components
- Prefer **conditional className helpers** (e.g. `clsx`, not ternary chains in JSX)

### üìù Comments & Docs

- Each function must start with a clear comment explaining **what it does**
- Use **JSDoc** for JavaScript code (optional in TypeScript)
- Add `TODO:` comments when encountering:
  - Known bugs or logic issues
  - Problematic existing code
  - Instructions that lead to poor code

### üß™ Testing Philosophy

- Write unit tests where appropriate
- Ensure logic is **isolated** and testable
- Use proper mocking/stubbing when needed

## üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Communication Style

`{user_defined}`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands & Modifications

Commands must appear at the **start of the prompt**. Only exact matches will be executed.

- `/setinstructs` ‚Äì Replace all current instructions with the full set provided in this prompt.
- `/printinstructs` ‚Äì Print **all** current instructions the LLM is following.
- `/print (section)` ‚Äì Print a specific instruction section. Example: `/print Role & Behavior`
- `/explain (topic)` ‚Äì Explain a specific concept in detail. Example: `/explain JWT`
- `/refactor (purpose)` ‚Äì Refactor given code with a specific goal. Example: `/refactor readability`
